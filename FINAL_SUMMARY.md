# Test with curl
curl -X POST https://localhost:61087/mcp/invoke \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"tools.list","params":{}}'
```

### SHORT-TERM (THIS WEEK)
```bash
# Run tests
dotnet test CrimeSolverAI.sln

# Create NuGet package
cd mcp-mssql-server
dotnet pack -c Release

# Update documentation for your specific use cases
```

### MEDIUM-TERM (THIS MONTH)
```bash
# Publish to NuGet (optional)
dotnet nuget push mcp-mssql-server/bin/Release/MCP.MSSQL.Server.*.nupkg \
