## QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF

- [x] Does the project build?
- [ ] Can I run the application?
- [x] Do the tests pass?
- [x] Can I see the GitHub repository?
- [ ] Do I understand the architecture?
- [ ] Can I modify the code and rebuild?

If all are YES, you're ready to move forward!

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

You'll know it's working when:
1. dotnet build shows "Build succeeded"
2. Application opens to https://localhost:61087
3. Dashboard displays in browser
4. dotnet test shows "passed" tests
